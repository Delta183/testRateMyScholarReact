# Rate My Scholar

https://rate-my-scholar-frontend.herokuapp.com/

## Background

This website is identical to Rate My Professor in that a user can choose to leave a review they had of a particular professor at a particular institution but our website differentiates itself in how one can provide feedback to all faculty and not just professors but rathers, staff and students alike. It serves to provide a means to gauge the professional quality of any of the aforementioned members.
This project was developed as a final project to a software engineering course. Developed in tandem to a server for this project.
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). 

## Setup

NOTE: This assumes you have installed a Node version >= 10 as per the [Create React App docs](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started/).

NOTE: In order for this website to function correctly, the associated server must be setup and initialized prior. 

Since we're using Create React App for this, setting it up after initializing the server requires the following command:

```
$ npm start
```

which as per the Create React docs does the following:

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## How to Use

Once you are on the main screen, you can navigate to the search to find the particular student, staff or professor at a particular school. This will take you to another page if the user exists or prompt you to create an entry for them if it does not yet exist. Once on the page for a certain scholar, you can peruse their rating and what the scores are saying about them with respect to their professional quality. One can also leave reviews of their own for the scholar.

## Deployment

Heroku makes it really easy to deploy Create React Apps and we followed the instructions from this [wiki](https://blog.heroku.com/deploying-react-with-zero-configuration).
